# Speculate And Correct Algorithm

This project was created as my senior project.

This project proposes an optimized version of the Bellman-Ford SSSP algorithm, which can carry out the SSSP algorithm more efficiently than the standard Bellman-Ford algorithm.

### Datasets
This project uses roadmap datasets from the [9th DIMACS Implementation Challenge](http://www.diag.uniroma1.it/challenge9/) - Shortest Paths. The datasets can be downloaded from the link [here.](http://www.diag.uniroma1.it/challenge9/download.shtml) 

### Solution Files
Each experiment algorithm in this project has been tested against solution files that were generated during the research. These solution files have been compared against solutions from the Gunrock Benckmarking Suite. Some solution files are included in the directory called "solution files".
